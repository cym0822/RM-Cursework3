	abstract = {Opinion mining or analysis of text are other terms for sentiment analysis. The fundamental objective is to extract meaningful information and data from unstructured text using natural language processing, statistical, and linguistics methodologies. This further is used for deriving qualitative and quantitative results on the scale of ‘positive’, ‘neutral’, or ‘negative to get the overall sentiment analysis. In this research, we worked with both approaches, machine learning, and an unsupervised lexicon-based algorithm for sentiment calculation and model performance. Stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) is utilized in this work for optimization for support vector machine ({SVM}) and logistic regression. {AFINN} and Vader lexicon are used for the lexicon model. Both the feature {TF}-{IDF} and bag of a word are used for classification. This dataset includes "Trip advisor hotel reviews". There are around 20k reviews in the dataset. Cleaned and preprocessed data were used in our work. We conducted some training and assessment. A classifier's accuracy is measured using evaluation metrics. In {TF}-{IDF}, the Support Vector Machine is the more accurate of the two classifiers used to assess machine learning accuracy. The classification rate in Bag of Words was 95.2 percent and the accuracy in {TF}-{IDF} was 96.3 percent on the support vector machine algorithm. {VADER} outperforms the Lexicon model with an accuracy of 88.7\%, whereas {AFINN} Lexicon has an accuracy of 86.0\%. When comparing the Supervised and unsupervised lexicon approaches, support vector machine model outperforms with a {TFIDF} accuracy of 96.3 percent and a {VADER} lexicon accuracy of 88.7\%.},

	abstract = {Microblogging websites like Twitter and Facebook, in this new era, is loaded with opinions and data. One of the most widely used micro-blogging site, Twitter, is where people share their ideas in the form of tweets and therefore it becomes one of the best sources for sentimental analysis. Opinions can be widely grouped into three categories good for positive, bad for negative and neutral and the process of analyzing differences of opinions and grouping them in all these categories is known as Sentiment Analysis.Data mining is basically used to uncover relevant information from web pages especially from the social networking sites. Merging data mining with other fields like text mining, {NLP} and computational intelligence we are able to classify tweets as good, bad or neutral. The main emphasis of this research is on the classification of emotions of tweets' data gathered from Twitter. In the past, researchers were using existing machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis but the results showed that existing machine learning techniques were not providing better results of sentiment classification. In order to improve classification results in the domain of sentiment analysis, we are using ensemble machine learning techniques for increasing the efficiency and reliability of proposed approach. For the same, we are merging Support Vector Machine with Decision Tree and experimental results prove that our proposed approach is providing better classification results in terms of f-measure and accuracy in contrast to individual classifiers.},

	abstract = {Recent systems have been developed for sentiment classiﬁcation, opinion recognition, and opinion analysis (e.g., detecting polarity and strength). We pursue another aspect of opinion analysis: identifying the sources of opinions, emotions, and sentiments. We view this problem as an information extraction task and adopt a hybrid approach that combines Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) and a variation of {AutoSlog} (Riloff, 1996a). While {CRFs} model source identiﬁcation as a sequence tagging task, {AutoSlog} learns extraction patterns. Our results show that the combination of these two methods performs better than either one alone. The resulting system identiﬁes opinion sources with 79.3\% precision and 59.5\% recall using a head noun matching measure, and 81.2\% precision and 60.6\% recall using an overlap measure.},

In this survey, we explore the effectiveness of many existing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We report the sets of optimal parameter values for each algorithm and the scores in both datasets. We finally observe that support vector machines are the best classifier and efforts to increase performance even more with bagging, boosting or voting ensemble schemes fail to do so.},

In the discipline of {NLP}, the objective of sentiment analysis is to extract positive things or negative things from social media. Researchers are driven to complete their sentiment analysis research because of the government and corporate organisations' and individuals' exponentially growing needs. This study optimises sentimental analysis using four cutting-edge machine learning classifiers: Naivebayes, J48, {BFTree}, and {OneR}. This four classification methods’ effectiveness are investigated and contrasted. While {OneR} appears more promise in producing the accuracy of correctly classified instances, Naivebayes was proven to be quick at learning. This study has observed that the four records are positively related, and the product's position in online market has also advanced over time. In light of the analysis of the favourable reviews and star ratings, this research study has suggested displaying a potentially successful or disastrous item based on the positive surveys. Finally, the relationship between the quantity of surveys and star ratings are also analyzed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for sentiment analysis in Facebook that, starting from messages written by users, supports: (i) to extract information about the users’ sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative), as transmitted in the messages they write; and (ii) to model the users’ usual sentiment polarity and to detect signiﬁcant emotional changes. We have implemented this method in {SentBuk}, a Facebook application also presented in this paper. {SentBuk} retrieves messages written by users in Facebook and classiﬁes them according to their polarity, showing the results to the users through an interactive interface. It also supports emotional change detection, friend’s emotion ﬁnding, user classiﬁcation according to their messages, and statistics, among others. The classiﬁcation method implemented in {SentBuk} follows a hybrid approach: it combines lexical-based and machine-learning techniques. The results obtained through this approach show that it is feasible to perform sentiment analysis in Facebook with high accuracy (83.27\%). In the context of e-learning, it is very useful to have information about the users’ sentiments available. On one hand, this information can be used by adaptive e-learning systems to support personalized learning, by considering the user’s emotional state when recommending him/her the most suitable activities to be tackled at each time. On the other hand, the students’ sentiments towards a course can serve as feedback for teachers, especially in the case of online learning, where face-to-face contact is less frequent. The usefulness of this work in the context of e-learning, both for teachers and for adaptive systems, is described too.},

In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French. We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn and evaluate several classiﬁcation models that can be conﬁgured in a cascaded pipeline. We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set. We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca. 83\% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features. The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca. 70 and 68\% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns. In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages. A substantial part of the article investigates the role of active learning techniques for reducing the number of examples to be manually annotated.},
